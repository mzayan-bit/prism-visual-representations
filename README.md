# PRISM — Probing the Evolution of Visual Representations

PRISM is an open-source, research-oriented computer vision platform engineered to systematically study how visual representations are acquired, structured, generalized, and transferred across different learning paradigms.

## Project Status

> [!NOTE]
> **Active Development**: PRISM has completed **Phase 15: Robustness & Distribution Shift Laboratory**.
> The platform introduces a complete mathematical and visual framework for measuring visual model and representation resilience under controlled distribution shifts: 6 standardized corruption families (Gaussian Noise, Spatial Blur, Brightness Shift, Contrast Shift, Rectangular Occlusion, Resolution Degradation) with calibrated severity levels (1 to 5), non-destructive `CorruptedDatasetView` evaluation over frozen models, paired representation drift analysis (Euclidean drift, cosine alignment, relative norm shifts), shared PCA coordinate projections where corrupted vectors are projected onto clean bases, $k$-NN neighborhood consistency retention, class centroid displacement tracking, ViT multi-head attention entropy shifts ($\Delta H$), a rigorous failure taxonomy, cross-architecture robustness benchmarks (CNN vs ResNet vs ViT), and an interactive Next.js PRISM Robustness Laboratory dashboard.

## Repository Architecture

PRISM is organized as a modular monorepo cleanly separating Python research components from configuration contracts, documentation, and the future web interface:
