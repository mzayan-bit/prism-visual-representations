# PRISM — Probing the Evolution of Visual Representations

PRISM is an open-source, research-oriented computer vision platform engineered to systematically study how visual representations are acquired, structured, generalized, and transferred across different learning paradigms.

## Project Status

> [!NOTE]
> **Active Development**: PRISM is implementing **Phase 12: Vision Transformers (ViT) & Attention Geometry**.
> The platform has established foundational Vision Transformer operations: spatial patch extraction with analytical 2D backward reconstruction (`PatchExtractor`), linear patch embedding (`PatchEmbedding`), shared class token injection with batch gradient accumulation (`ClassToken`), learnable 1D positional embeddings (`PositionalEmbedding`), numerically stable scaled dot-product attention (`ScaledDotProductAttention`), and multi-head self-attention with complete analytical backpropagation through projections (`MultiHeadSelfAttention`). Attention weight distributions are monitored through statistical contracts (`AttentionTensorSummary`, `AttentionHeadSummary`).
>
> Full Vision Transformer model integration, transformer encoder blocks, and observatory UI interfaces will be completed in subsequent prompts.

## Repository Architecture

PRISM is organized as a modular monorepo cleanly separating Python research components from configuration contracts, documentation, and the future web interface:
